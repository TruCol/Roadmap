\section{Cost Model}\label{sec:cost_model}
This section describes the expected costs to bring the TruCol company to an operational break-even. These costs are described in the form of a cost model, that is described in \cref{subsec:model_description} and specified in \cref{subsec:specification}. The assumptions are given in \cref{subsec:assumptions}.

\subsection{Description}\label{subsec:model_description}
The total costs are computed based on the following 2 factors:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The cumulative amount of human labour hours that are planned to be executed, multiplied with their respective hourly wage costs.
	\item Bounty subsidisation to attract new users.
	\item Buffer costs to generate wide-spread adoption of the TruCol protocol.
\end{itemize}
