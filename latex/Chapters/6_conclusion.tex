\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This document presents the planning to develop the healthy TruCol company within the timeframe of roughly 9 months, and documents the assumptions and methods used to generate this planning. The main tasks in this planning are composed of decentralised technology development, TruCol platform development and business development. A total labour cost of roughly \euro$470k$ is estimated, and another \euro$100k$ is estimated for bounty subsidisation and as a buffer.

At the end of this planning, the TruCol company is expected to sustainably operate, generating ROI. Our aim is to gradually increase the cultivation of the diversification potential of the TruCol protocol at this point, whilst starting to develop a strategy to develop our own in-house automation/AI-engine based on the dataset that we continuously grow.
