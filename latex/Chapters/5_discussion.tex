\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
The hourly wage estimates for the senior decentralised technology development, platform development and business estimates could be refined by using databases of competitive salaries for the respective tasks/work. Furthermore, a refinement of the duration estimates is proposed at the moment the tasks are started, as we expect more relevant information will be available at those times. In addition, external resources should be addressed to check whether any (critical) components are omited in this Gantt planning.
