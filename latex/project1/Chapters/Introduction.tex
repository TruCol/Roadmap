\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Welcome, this document presents the roadmap for the TruCol company as well as the estimated costs of the accompanying human labour and other posts. The objective of this document is to provide some basic insight into the order of magnitude of the costs of developing a sustainable variant of the TruCol company such that it is able to generate returns for its potential investors.

\Cref{sec:assumptions} specifies the assumptions, \cref{sec:model_description} describes how the costs are estimated, \cref{sec:results} presents the projected basic planning and briefly details what each activity in the Gantt chart represents. \Cref{sec:discussion} provides some nuance on the accuracy of the estimates, and \cref{sec:conclusion} summarises the body of information in this document.
