\section{Cost Model Description}\label{sec:model_description}
The total costs are computed based on two factors.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The cumulative amount of human labor hours that are planned to be executed, multiplied with their respective hourly wage costs as specified in \cref{sec:assumptions}. 
	\item A combination of bounty subsidation and buffer costs of \euro$100.000,-$ are estimated to generate wide-spread adoption of the TruCol protocol.
\end{itemize}
