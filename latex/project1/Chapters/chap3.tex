\Cref{fig:gantt} contains the Gantt chart that is generated to plan the development of the TruCol company. One can observe that several of the development-activities can be performed in parallel, these are accordingly stacked vertically. Dependencies of outputs of activities imply a "stairway" pattern in the Gantt chart.

\section{Cost estimates}
After multiplying the amount of labour hours with their respective hourly labour costs, a total estimated labour costs of \euro$470.400,-$ is generated. This is composed of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Decentralised Tech Developent: \euro$252.000,-$ 
	\item Platform Developent: \euro$112.000,-$ 
	\item Business Development \euro$106.400,-$ 
\end{itemize}
An additional \euro$100.000,-$ are included for bounty subsidation and as a buffer, yielding a total expected cost to create a healthy company of roughly \euro$470.000+$\euro$100.000=$\euro$570.000,-$ which is rounded to approximately .6 Meuro.
